# Lab: Semantic HTML Markup Exercise

## Objective
Participants will apply their understanding of **Semantic HTML** by analyzing and annotating a real-world webpage, identifying where semantic elements should be used.

## Instructions

### 1. **Access Your Miro Section**
Each group (or individual) should pick a website they use every day, take a screenshot of it, and upload it to the shared **Miro board** for annotation.

### 2. **Identify Semantic HTML Elements**
- Examine the webpage layout.
- Annotate sections of the page where **semantic elements** should be used.
- Start with the following elements but feel free to add more:
  - `<header>`: Page header or navigation bar.
  - `<nav>`: Main site navigation.
  - `<main>`: Core content area.
  - `<section>`: Thematically related content sections.
  - `<article>`: Self-contained content, such as blog posts.
  - `<aside>`: Sidebars or related content.
  - `<footer>`: Page footer containing metadata or links.
  - `<figure>` & `<figcaption>`: Images with captions.
  - `<details>` & `<summary>`: Expandable content.

### 3. **Annotate with Justifications**
For each semantic element, add a **brief note** explaining why it was chosen. 

### 4. **Review & Discuss**
- Review annotations with your group.
- Compare your markup decisions with others.
- Discuss any differences and refine your choices.

### 5. **Wrap-Up**
- Present your findings to the larger group.
- Reflect on how semantic elements improve **accessibility, SEO, and maintainability**.
- Look at the url for the actual webpage to see if the developers who made it agreed with your decisions.
