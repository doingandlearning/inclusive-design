				# Introduction to Semantic HTML
			
---
				- **What is Semantic HTML?**
					- Using HTML elements that convey meaning about their content.
				- **Why It Matters?**
					- Improves accessibility by providing better context to assistive technologies.
					- Enhances SEO and maintainability.
				
				
				Note:
				Semantic HTML improves both accessibility and usability. Using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` instead of `<div>` provides clear structure and meaning to content.
