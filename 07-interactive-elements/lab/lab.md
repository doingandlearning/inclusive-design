## üß™ Observational Lab: Real-World Interactive Accessibility

### üéØ Objective  
Build your *critical eye* by identifying how well (or poorly) real websites implement accessible interactive elements ‚Äî **without writing code**.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è Instructions

1. **Choose a website** to audit:  
   - You can pick from the list below or choose one you visit regularly.
   - Prefer sites with menus, tabs, modals, accordions, or form elements.

2. **Explore with your keyboard**  
   - Use `Tab`, `Enter`, `Esc`, and arrow keys to navigate.
   - Can you **access every interactive element**?
   - Is the **focus visible**?

3. **Check accessibility with browser tools**
   - Use DevTools (Elements ‚Üí Accessibility tree)
   - Are interactive roles and states present (e.g. `aria-expanded`, `role="button"` on non-buttons)?

4. **Take notes on what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not**
   - Good example: Native `<button>` with `aria-expanded`, focus styles, toggles a panel.
   - Bad example: Clickable `<div>` with no focus style or keyboard support.

5. (Optional) **Try a screen reader**  
   - Even a quick test with macOS VoiceOver or NVDA is eye-opening.

### üîç Things to Look For

| ‚úÖ Good Practices | ‚ùå Bad Practices |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Native `<button>` and `<a>` elements | Clickable `<div>` with no `tabindex` or `role` |
| Clear visual focus indicators | Focus ring removed or invisible |
| ARIA state attributes (like `aria-expanded`) | No feedback for state changes |
| Keyboard accessibility (`Tab`, `Enter`, `Esc`) | Requires mouse or touchscreen only |

### ‚úçÔ∏è Deliverable

Write up (or share aloud):
- **One good example** and why it worked well.
- **One bad example** and how it could be improved.

You can even paste a snippet or screenshot if it helps.
