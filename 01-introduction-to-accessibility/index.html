                # Introduction to Accessibility
                
                - Why accessibility matters
                - Ethical, legal, and business perspectives
                - Overview of WCAG principles (POUR)
                
                
                Note:
                Accessibility ensures inclusivity for users with diverse needs, including disabilities and neurodiversity. WCAG's four principles—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust—serve as foundational guidelines.

                # Poll: Accessibility Experience
                
                - Have you tested a website for accessibility before?
                  - ✅ Yes
                  - ❌ No
                  
                
                Note:
                This poll engages participants and helps gauge their familiarity with accessibility. Encourage discussion about past experiences.

                # Common Barriers
                
                - **Visual**: Colour contrast, screen readers
                - **Motor**: Large touch targets, keyboard navigation
                - **Cognitive**: Clear layouts, readable fonts
                
                Note:
                Understanding common barriers is crucial. Example: Users with motor disabilities may struggle with small buttons or complex navigation.

				# Why Accessibility Matters for Everyone
				---
				- Accessibility benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.
				- When we're **tired or overwhelmed**, our cognitive capacities are reduced.
				- If we've **forgotten our glasses**, we experience visual impairments.
				- Wearing **gloves in winter** can create motor issues.
				- Accessible design improves usability for all users, enhancing the overall experience.
				
				Note:
				Accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about improving the experience for everyone. Situational limitations (e.g., being in bright sunlight, using a touchscreen with gloves) can affect users in ways similar to permanent disabilities. Making a site accessible ensures it remains usable for all.

				# Legal, Ethical & Business Perspectives
				---
				- **Legal**: UK Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (2018), Equality Act (2010), WCAG compliance.
				- **Ethical**: Ensuring inclusivity, equal access to digital services, and social responsibility.
				- **Business**: Wider audience reach, improved usability, reduced legal risks, and enhanced reputation.
				
				
				Note:
				Accessibility is legally required for UK government services under the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018. The **Equality Act 2010** also mandates non-discrimination against disabled users. Ethically, providing accessible digital services aligns with public sector values of inclusivity and fairness. From a business perspective, accessible websites improve user experience, reduce legal risks, and enhance public trust.

			# UK Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (2018)
			
			---
			- **Legal Requirement**: All public sector websites and apps must be accessible.
			- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Sites must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
			- **Exemptions**: Some archived content and certain organisations may be exempt.
			- **Accessibility Statements**: Required for transparency and compliance.
			- **Enforcement**: Monitored by the **Government Digital Service (GDS)**, with penalties for non-compliance.
			
			
			Note:
			The UK Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (2018) require public sector websites and mobile apps to be **perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust**. Compliance with **WCAG 2.1 AA** is mandatory, ensuring digital services are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Government Digital Service (GDS) oversees enforcement, and organisations must publish an **accessibility statement** explaining their compliance.

				# Overview of WCAG Principles
				---
				- **Perceivable**: Information must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., text alternatives for images, captions for videos).
				- **Operable**: The interface must be usable via keyboard navigation and assistive technologies.
				- **Understandable**: Content must be clear, readable, and predictable in behaviour.
				- **Robust**: Must be compatible with current and future assistive technologies.
				
				
				Note:
				The **WCAG principles** (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust) ensure that digital content is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. These guidelines help create an inclusive web experience, making information adaptable to assistive technologies and user needs.
