### **Activity: Spot the Accessibility Issues**
#### **Step 1: Group Discussion**
- Ask participants:  
  **"Have you ever encountered a website, app, or service that was difficult to use? What made it frustrating?"**  
- Encourage them to share real-life experiences, whether related to disability or situational impairments (e.g., using a phone in bright sunlight, struggling with small buttons).

#### **Step 2: Find an Example**
- Individually or in small groups, have participants **find an example of an inaccessible design**:
  - A website with poor contrast.
  - A form without labels.
  - A button that is too small or not keyboard-accessible.
  - A site that doesnâ€™t work well on mobile.
- They can **use their own devices** or think of past experiences.

#### **Step 3: Share and Reflect**
- Each group presents **one example** they found.
- Discuss:
  - **What makes it inaccessible?**
  - **Who might struggle with it?**
  - **How could it be improved?**
- Relate findings back to **WCAG principles** and why accessibility benefits everyone.
