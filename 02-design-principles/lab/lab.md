### **Exercise: Accessibility Audit – Design Principles**
#### **Objective**  
Participants will evaluate a website’s **accessibility across all five design principles** covered in this module and identify **good and bad examples** for each.

#### **Instructions**
1. **Choose a Website:**  
   - Select a **public website** or an **internal project** (if applicable).
   - You may use **government sites, news portals, or e-commerce platforms** as test cases.
   
2. **Audit Each Category:**  
   - For each **design principle**, find one **good** and one **bad** example from the site:
     - **Colour Contrast**: Are all text elements legible? Do they meet WCAG contrast requirements?
     - **Colour Blindness Considerations**: Are there any elements where colour alone conveys meaning? Are alternative indicators used?
     - **Large Touch Targets**: Are buttons and interactive elements large enough? Are they well-spaced?
     - **Clear Layout**: Is the page easy to navigate? Is content structured logically?
     - **Readable Fonts**: Are the fonts legible? Is line spacing appropriate?

3. **Document Findings:**  
   - Take **screenshots** and annotate them where necessary.
   - Provide a **brief explanation** of what works well and what doesn’t.
   - Suggest **improvements** for areas that fail.
